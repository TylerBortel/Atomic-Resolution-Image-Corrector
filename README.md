Necessary inputs:   
 - Atomic Resolution Image featuring p3 symmetry or higher (such as HOPG) as a .jpg or .tif  
 - FFT of said image  
  
Instructions:  
 - Download all files and store in a single folder  
 - Alter GetImage and GetImageFFT to include a more relevant filepath (optional, and should not be necessary in final version)  
 - Run Main1, selecting the relevant FFT  
 - Click on 3 non colinear peaks to reveal their coordinates. Either note these coordinates separately or drag the windown to the side--the next step will cover the initial location of that window with another  
 - Run Correct_Original_Image, selecting the relevant image  
 - Enter the location of the three peaks  
 - After the correction is made, a preview should appear, and you should be prompted to save the final file
